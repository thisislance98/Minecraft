## Custom Rules

make sure you verify and test that fixes and new features work.. Try to use a test cli.. if it doesn't have functionality to do the test then add it. you can also use playwright mcp or curl if either of these would be easier. make sure you have enough logging to debug any issues.. if you create any test files, clean them up when you are done
